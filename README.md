#### AJ's Unit 5 Final

I'm way too sick to think. 
Sad I didn't get to make my database. :(
Api was tedious. Not hard, just tedious.
The germs win. I'm trying to muster the energy to make the thumbnails less pixelated and orientation screens, but all my muscles hurt and everything is the worst.

Overall the test was aight. Sucks there was no time to make a db though, I just figured them out!

stay away from the germs.
